# Workato CLI Use Cases

## Individual Developer Use Cases

### Local Recipe Development
Build and validate integration recipes locally before deployment to avoid production issues.

#### Benefits
- Catch syntax errors early
- Version control integration recipes
- Test recipe logic without affecting live systems
- Faster development cycles

#### Commands
```bash
workato recipes validate --path ./recipes/salesforce-sync.json
workato push --restart-recipes
```

### Multi-Environment Management
Manage development, staging, and production environments with separate configurations.

#### Benefits
- Isolated testing environments
- Safe promotion workflows
- Environment-specific configurations
- Rollback capabilities

#### Workflow
```bash
# Development
workato profiles use dev
workato push

# Staging
workato profiles use staging
workato pull
workato push --restart-recipes

# Production
workato profiles use production
workato pull
```

## Team & Organization Use Cases

### Team Collaboration
Share recipes and connections across development teams with standardized workflows.

#### Benefits
- Consistent project structures
- Shared connection configurations
- Code review processes for integrations
- Knowledge sharing

#### Workflow
```bash
# Developer A
workato push --include-tags

# Developer B
workato pull
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration
Automate recipe deployment as part of build and release pipelines.

#### Benefits
- Consistent deployment process
- Automated validation gates
- Environment promotion workflows
- Reduced manual errors

#### Implementation
```bash
# In CI pipeline
workato recipes validate --path ./recipes/*.json
workato push --restart-recipes --include-tags
```

### Recipe Lifecycle Management
Standardize how recipes are created, tested, deployed, and monitored across teams.

#### Operations
- Validate recipes before deployment
- Start/stop recipes for maintenance
- Monitor recipe execution
- Update connections programmatically

#### Commands
```bash
workato recipes validate --path ./recipe.json
workato recipes start --id 12345
workato recipes stop --id 67890
workato connections create-oauth --parent-id 123
```

## AI Agent & Automation Use Cases

### AI-Assisted Recipe Building
Guide developers through complex integration patterns with automated validation.

#### Benefits
- Reduce integration complexity
- Suggest best practices automatically
- Catch common mistakes early
- Accelerate learning curve

#### Process
- AI analyzes recipe structure
- Validates against Workato patterns
- Suggests optimizations
- Guides connection setup

### Automated Connection Management
Handle OAuth flows and credential management programmatically.

#### Benefits
- Eliminate manual OAuth setup
- Bulk connection creation
- Secure credential handling
- Environment-specific configurations

#### Commands
```bash
workato connections create-oauth --parent-id 123
workato connections get-oauth-url --id 456
```

### Error Resolution & Monitoring
Automatically diagnose and resolve common integration issues.

#### Benefits
- Proactive issue detection
- Automated troubleshooting
- Performance monitoring
- Reduced downtime

#### Monitoring
```bash
workato recipes list --running
workato recipes list --stop-cause trigger_errors_limit
```

## Enterprise Integration Scenarios

### API Management
Centralize API collection management and deployment across multiple environments.

#### Benefits
- Consistent API definitions
- Version control for API specs
- Automated API deployment
- Environment-specific configurations

#### Implementation
```bash
workato api-collections create --format yaml --content ./api-spec.yaml --name "Customer API"
```

### Data Operations
Manage large-scale data synchronization and transformation workflows.

#### Benefits
- Batch processing capabilities
- Data validation and cleansing
- Error handling and retry logic
- Audit trails and monitoring

### Project Organization
Structure projects for scalability and maintainability across large teams.

#### Benefits
- Consistent folder structures
- Shared naming conventions
- Access control management
- Dependency tracking

#### Organization
- Group recipes by business function
- Use descriptive connection names
- Implement consistent tagging
- Regular cleanup and maintenance

## Getting Started Recommendations

### For Individual Developers
1. Start with `workato init` to configure your environment
2. Use `workato recipes validate` for local development
3. Set up profiles for different environments

### For Development Teams
1. Establish shared project structures
2. Implement code review processes for recipes
3. Use CI/CD pipelines for deployments

### For Enterprise Organizations
1. Create standardized development workflows
2. Implement proper access controls and environments
3. Use monitoring and alerting for production systems

Perfect for:
- **Developers**: Local-first development with validation and testing
- **Teams**: Collaborative workflows with version control integration
- **Enterprises**: Scalable automation with governance and monitoring
- **AI Agents**: Automated assistance with recipe development and troubleshooting
